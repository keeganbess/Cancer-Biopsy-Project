# Release Candidate Cancer Biopsy Project

## Usability
The project beta build was based on finalizing and ordering the PCB for testing. Through continued testing with the circuit board of parts, this demo was able to show that the pcb design works and is possible to stop the motor based off of the stall current for the motor. The main parts include the voltage regulator, the current sensors, the new microcontroller, leds, a switch, a button, motor driver, resistors and capacitors. The code for our microchip is ready, however the PCB that was ordered was delayed but should come within the next week.
