# Cancer-Biopsy-Project

## Usability
This project’s alpha build is based on finalizing parts and connections for the schematic. All of the individual parts for this project have been purchased and the task now is ensuring that the schematic that has been created will work as intended. These parts include the voltage regulator, the current sensors, the new microcontroller, leds, a switch, a button, motor driver, resistors and capacitors.. Other parts such as the battery and the motor, are set to remain the same from the earlier design prototype so they can be removed from the exterior housing to test with this setup on the breadboard.  As of right now, the baseline code for our microchip is ready to be tested and is being waited on for the actual chip to arrive in the mail. 

Currently I am working with the aRduino Leonardo to check the  state diagram based code as it has the same microchip that we plan to use for the PCB(ATmega32U4). This code is fairly intuitive as it reads the current value from the INA219, which will be the motor current, and based on the state will stop the motor during the cutting and extraction state. Also in the works is a serial interaction between the microchip and a PC that will allow for the reading of current, velocity and force to be outputted in a terminal. These values will be useful for further testing of the device itself, specifically the current read from the sensor, as well as varying different parameters to see their effect on the sample quality that is outputted.  

## Build Quality
Before the PCB is purchased, our team wanted to ensure that the schematic we designed is plausible and functional to prevent the need to purchase multiple PCBs. Therefore we have bought all of the parts and are working on connecting them with a breadboard, following the schematic that is in my github repository. We are still waiting on one motor driver from Pololu to get here but meanwhile we have been working on improving other portions of the design that will help with testing and later patenting. Specifically there are works on the mechanical side of things to focus on the needle and the force at which the vacuum has on the extraction. Also there has been efforts to improve the stiffness of the testing gelatin that will later be used when we have the new PCB within the exterior housing. The stiffness is important to try to get it closest to tissue so that it properly demonstrates to others that it can in fact extract the desired lesion with proper size and zero biopsy rate. 

We are working on figuring out the size for the PCB to indicate if we need to work on remaking the design of the exterior housing which is 3D printed. However, our current prediction is that we shouldn’t have to alter the housing and we can reuse the same design as is present in the current prototype. This design is considered ideal for a handheld device as it is round and smaller meaning it is easy to hold ad more desirable according to prior studies.
